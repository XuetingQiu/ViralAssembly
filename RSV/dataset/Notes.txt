notes:
Somehow, the program does not consider all my RSV fasta file as fasta file. 
So I have to copied them to the previous NDV fasta file, which worked for creating NDV profile. 

The command also asked for specify "alphabet", due to there are Ns in the data. So the command:
In LABEL_RES, scripts folder:
./modelfromalign_Darwin XX.hmm -alignfile xx.fasta -alphabet "DNA"
